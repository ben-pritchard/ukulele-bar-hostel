QUESTIONS:

Why does "Answer Page" show up in the Navigation menu even though it's labeled as MENU_CALLBACK in the sum module?





BREWPAL:

Idea for getting used to submitting patch requests:

- Put module code into a coding standard checker (maybe through Coder module or through "atom drupal package")
- Submit an issue
- Submit the patch with the improved coding standards!
